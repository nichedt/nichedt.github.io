        Seeing as these posts will be assigned numbers, it seems only fitting to define what a number is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number)" target="_blank">1st</a> place (there I go, using another number). There are many, various definitions, but here is one of mine:
        <span class = "indent_block">
            Numbers are a human construction made for and used in counting
        </span>
        Well the question that you should be asking now is "What does 'counting' even mean?" And I'm sorry to inform you, but, as with all fundamental definitions nowadays, all I can really do is point you back to where we started- counting is merely assigning a number to a collection of objects.

        It all starts with the number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number)" target="_blank">1</a>. The number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_(number)" target="_blank">1</a> defines what we are counting in the first place. It could be apples, millimeters, or cars. In any case, it represents the unit that we are using for our measurements.
